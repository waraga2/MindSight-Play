# Mindsight Trainer

## Description

Mindsight is the ability to remote view objects either in your local environment or global locations, the ability could extend even to the galactic level, who knows the limit to this? The very first step is, to see objects infront of you with a blindold on, or eyes closed, whichever combination you prefer, as long as the eyes are technically covered then you can begin the adventure. MindSight Play allows you to harness this innate ability inorder to be able to not just sense the physical world on an intuitive level, but to also see the physical world in realtime, while the physical eyes are closed. I beleive this ability is key to aid the blind to see again, as well as, help humanity expand its consciounses as we are able to perceive much more of the physical world than we would with just eye sight. This is truly remarkable...

Again, what is Mindsight Play? its an interactive training tool designed to help anyone learn to read numbers, letters, and shapes while their eyes are closed, in a fun and engaging way. The application displays characters on the screen and announces them, creating a multisensory learning experience. It features several modes, including numbers, letters, shapes, and a mixed mode that combines all character types. The display duration is adjustable, allowing users to customize the pace of the training. Enjoy the journey
